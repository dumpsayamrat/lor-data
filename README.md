# My data engineer project
This is a repo where I practice and try to learn tech stack for data engineering

## What have I learned so far?
- Data exploration: [Selenuim](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- Data processing: [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) and [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
- Data orchestration platform: [Dagster](https://dagster.io/)


## What's next?
- Using Delta Lake for adding Database features to cloud storage
- Build pipelines to loading data from cloud storage to store in data warehouse for analytic purposes
- Data visualization using Apache superset
- ML
